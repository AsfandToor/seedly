### ðŸš€ Added

- Initial release of `Seedly` â€” AI-based seeding agent for databases.
- CLI support with `seedly start "<prompt>" --dialect ...` usage.
- Support for multiple dialects:
  - âœ… SQLite
  - âœ… PostgreSQL
  - âœ… MySQL
  - âœ… MongoDB (with Mongoose models or schema inference)
- Intelligent schema parsing using:
  - `getColumns`, `listTables`, and `getSchema` abstraction per dialect
  - LLM-based prompt interpretation and fake data generation
- Support for both:
  - `--models-dir` (Mongoose schema directory)
  - `--single-schema` (Mongoose `.js` file path for new collections)
- SDK usage: `new Seedly({...}).seedTool(...)`
- Agent can seed, query, and describe schema with natural language
- Express.js integration example provided
- CLI auto-exits after successful run (`process.exit(0)`)
- Unit tests for SDK and CLI (using Vitest + SQLite memory or disk)
- Support for both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` via `.env`
